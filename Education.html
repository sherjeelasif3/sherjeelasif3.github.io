				<u>★ Cooper Elementary School</u>
				<br>
				<p>During my childhood, I went to Cooper School, which was a K-8 Elementary and middle school. I had some of my best times there as a kid. I made many friends, some of which I am still friends with today! It has a special place in my heart as I was there for 10 years of my life.</p>

				<h3 style="color:blue">High School</h3>
				<u>★ Ronald Reagan Highschool</u>
				<br>
				<p>For highschool, I went to a local school which was a block or two away from Cooper. This is where I really developed who I was as a person and found my life-long friends. Reagan was an IB school, which meant that I had to option to take higher level courses and challenge my academics, which is exactly what I did. I learned under amazing teachers and staff and am very happy I got to go to school here.</p>

				<h3 style="color:blue">College</h3>
				<u>★ University of Wisconsin-Madison</u>
				<br>
				<p>Last but not least, College. I am currently a second semester freshman in college, and I would be lying if I said I didnt like it. College has been a major change in how I live my life. I have been given so much more freedom and I kind of like it. I currently live in the Witte residence hall on the MLC (multicultural learning community). The MLC is the best thing that happened to me in college. It is the reason why I have the friends I do. Apart from that, I am currently studying aeropace engineering. So far, the classes have been enough to manage but I can definetly see the intensity turning up in the next couple semesters. </p>
